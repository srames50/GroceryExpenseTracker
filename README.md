# GroceryExpenseTracker

This is a simple budget tracker application that allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. The app provides a budget form for users to input their budget and an expense form for users to input their expenses. The app will then display the user's balance and a list of their expenses. The user can also edit or delete expenses from the list. This project was created by following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
